#### Your teamâ€™s hackathon idea in One sentence: 
##### `An app that provides real-time feedback on diabetes management with a color-coded system (red for no meal uploads, yellow for one-two meal uploads, green for three meal uploads) by taking into account user inputs such as fitness level, age, diabetes type, height, weight, daily physical activity, water and food intake, sleep patterns, and watch data to offer personalized blood sugar predictions, meal recommendations, workout regimens, and culturally tailored recipes, along with a "Takeout near me" feature for location-based dietary suggestions aligned with personal goals and preferences.`

#### Hackathon Five CORE Themes. `CHECK ONE or TWO QUESTIONS (insert X in [ ])`.
- [ ] Access to care
> How can we make it easier to access care (especially specialists) and provide clear, timely notifications, and reminders along their healthcare journey?
- [ ] Patient satisfaction
> How can we make it more convenient for patients to provide real-time feedback about their healthcare experience through a mobile app?
- [ x ] New patient experience
> As a potential new customer, how can we leverage the mobile app to help new patients better understand what services are available to them?
- [ x ] Managing my health
> Itâ€™s easy to get overwhelmed by all the tasks patients often have to do to maintain their health, how can we make managing health more enjoyable?
- [ ] Addressing mental health challenges
> Mental health challenges may be difficult to identify and have a broad impact on health, how can we help clinicians be more in tune with patients mental health needs?

#### Optional Questions. `TEAMS CAN SELECT ONE ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL QUESTION (insert X in [ ])`
- [ x ] Cultural Competence in Healthcare
> How can we design a mobile app that helps healthcare providers better understand and respect cultural differences, improving communication and care for diverse patient populations?
- [ ] Access to Care for Rural and Remote Communities
> How can we leverage technology to improve healthcare access for rural and remote communities, ensuring timely and specialized care for those in underserved areas? (Focus on SDSU Imperial Valley Connection - Rural/Remote)
- [ ] Enhancing disease prevention (For Geocomputational Thinker Awards)
> How can big (geospatial) data analytics and AI be used to improve access to information about the influence of human behavior, cultural practices, and social interactions on the spread of diseases?
- [ ] Addressing environmental health disparities (For Geocomputational Thinker Awards)
> How can we leverage big (geospatial) data analytics and AI to improve access to resources that mitigate the impact of environmental factors, i.e. pollution, on health disparities?

Project Name: GlucoPal

Objective: To create a comprehensive diabetes management app that offers real-time feedback and personalized recommendations based on user inputs, aimed at improving the daily lives of diabetic patients.

Problem Statement: Diabetic patients often struggle with managing their condition due to the complexities of tracking all moving parts necessary for the disease. Existing solutions lack personalized feedback and cultural considerations, making it difficult for users to maintain consistent and effective diabetes management

Solution Overview:
GlucoPal: An app that uses a color-coded system (red, yellow, green) to provide real-time feedback on meal uploads and overall diabetes management. 
Integration of various used inputs and predictive models to offer tailored recommendations for blood sugar management

Key Features:
Real-time Feedback: Color-coded system indicating daily progress (red for no meal uploads, yellow for one-two, green for three).
Personalization: Inputs include fitness level, age, diabetes type, height, weight, daily physical activity, water intake, food inputs, and sleep patterns.
Dietary Recommendations: Offers meal time recommendations, a cultural cookbook, and a "Takeout near me" feature with location-specific suggestions.
Predictive Blood Sugar Model: Uses historical and real-time data to provide blood sugar predictions and provide user with relevant suggestions.
Physical Activity Tracking: Custom workout regimens based on availability, willingness, and dietary inputs.
Integration with Wearables: Can take inputs from smartwatches for physical activity and sleep tracking.
User Preferences: Allows users to input dietary preferences and rate meals to tailor future recommendations.

User Experience:
Onboarding: Users input their personal health data and preferences.
Daily Use: Users log meals, physical activity, water intake, and sleep. The app provides real-time feedback and suggestions, and has reward system in place for updating meals into the app.

Technical Implementation:
Data Collection: Integration with APIs for health data from wearables, manual input for meals, water intake, and physical activity.
Predictive Analytics: Machine learning models to predict blood sugar levels and provide tailored recommendations.
User Interface: Intuitive and user-friendly design with real-time feedback.
Backend: Secure database for storing user data, ensuring privacy and compliance with health data regulations.

Market Potential:
Millions of diabetic patients globally who could benefit from a personalized and comprehensive diabetes management tool.
Opportunities for partnerships with healthcare providers, nutritionists, and fitness experts.

Impacts and Benefits:
Improved diabetes management through personalized recommendations and real-time feedback.
Enhanced quality of life for diabetic patients by making daily management more convenient and effective.
